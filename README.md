## Prequisits

* Make sure you have xcode command line utilities installed
```shell script
sudo xcode-select --install

* Create 2 certificates at [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com)
  * `Developer ID Application`
  * `Developer ID Installer`
* Add them to your "KeyChain Access" Application

## Building

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/mac-codesigner-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`
